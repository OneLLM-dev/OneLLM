# OneLLM:

# OneLLM was a project that aimed to create a single interface for interacting with multiple LLMs. It was built using the Rust programming language and Axum.
# It was live from 11 July 2025 to 28 August 2025.
# This one project taught me more than any other project I have done.
# I put it under the MIT license, so that others can use it to learn from it.
# You have the right to use it for any purpose, and if you make money off of it, just open an issue to let me know.

# Thank you for using OneLLM!
